honed

I have ruined many tool edges by overheating them with a grinding wheel. I have used files, but they seem kind of expensive...
One alternative is a coarse carborundum sharpening stone. They make some specifically for this task. "Garden tool sharpener" is a generic term for this tool and unrelated
 "Cigar stone" seems to be a U.K. term.
